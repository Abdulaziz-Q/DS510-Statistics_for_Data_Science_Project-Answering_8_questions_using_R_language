# DS510-final_project
DS510 Statistics for Data Science is one of the master's courses

#### We asked to answer the following 8 questions using R language
1. Derive descriptive statistics regarding this dataset, including measures of central tendency.
2. The WHO_Suicide_Statistics.csv file contains few missing entries in the file. Find out how many rows have the missing values. How would you deal with these missing values for your analysis?	
3. For a country of your choice, add two new columns (percentage change in population and percentage change in suicides) and represent graphically if there is any correlation between these two parameters? 	
4. Compare the total number of suicides for each age group with total population of the same age group. Is there any association between these two factors? Also, find the ratio between the total number of suicides per age group and its population and explain the significance of this ratio.	
5. Analyze the number of suicides by age group for male and female. Depict graphically which category (Male or Female) is more prone to suicide?			
6. For a particular year, find out the top 10 (Ten) countries which have the highest number of suicides and plot the visualization graph between country and number of suicides.
7. Does population influence the total number of suicides? Justify your answer. 
8. For any five countries, create a least-square model of the total number of suicides and estimate the total number of suicides in next ten years from the last available data (for example, the last available data for Thailand is 2016) in the file.
